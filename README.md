# TravelMatch

**Gift travel experiences to the people you love.**

TravelMatch is a platform where you can send monetary gifts for travel experiences. Recipients must
provide proof of completing the experience before funds are released — turning every gift into a
guaranteed memory.

---

## 🎁 How It Works

1. **Create a Moment** — Define a travel experience you want to gift
2. **Gift & Send** — Send it to someone with funds held in escrow
3. **Prove It** — Recipient uploads proof (photos, location, receipts)
4. **Release Funds** — AI verifies the proof, money transfers automatically
